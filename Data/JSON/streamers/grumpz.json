I play EFT, WZ, Outriders, WoW, Destiny 2, Squad, some simulation games.\n I'm always open to trying new games, and find it hard to just stick to one game with all these amazing games that are out and available to play.\n You can find me streaming every night at around 8pm CST expect for Tuesdays and Saturdays. On Tuesdays I try to stream during the day, starting at around 9am CST.\n\n__Twitch Link__\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/grumpzttv",
